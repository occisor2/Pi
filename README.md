# Pi

This is a small python program that computes digits of Pi indefintely.
The statistics about the performance are displayed at the top. 

The algorithm is an implementation of Jeremy Gibbons spigot algorithm,
specifically the one based on Gosper's series, which he explained in
this
[paper](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/spigot.pdf).
I used [this
implementation](https://www.gavalas.dev/blog/spigot-algorithms-for-pi-in-python/)
for my program.

## Running

'''
python pi.py
